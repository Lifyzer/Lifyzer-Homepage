Nova groups for food processing


The NOVA classification system classifys the products into 4 large groups depending on their degree of processing the food, and not on their nutritional quality (unlike the Nutriscore).

It is a great system for easily recognising ultra-processed foodstuffs.


The NOVA groups are:
Group 1 => Unprocessed or minimally processed foods.
Group 2 => Processed culinary ingredients.
Group 3 => Processed foods.
Group 4 => Ultra-processed food and drink products.


Not all processed nutriments are bad for health, but there are serious doubts about the harmful effects on health.
